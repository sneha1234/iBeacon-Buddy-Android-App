    <string name="str_menu_information">MapCalibrator takes an image of a custom map and calibrates it to the real world using 2, 3 or 4 reference points. Use the built in camera function to take a picture of a map or store a digital copy of a map in the MapCalibrator folder in the external storage folder, usually /sdcard.&lt;p>Use the &lt;strong>menu&lt;/strong> button to see all available options.&lt;p>The intended workflow is:&lt;br>1. Import a map from a file (or the camera).&lt;br>2. Create a reference point.&lt;br>3. Position the reference point at your current position on the map.&lt;br>4. Store the reference point.&lt;br>5. Continue to create new reference points until you are satisfied with the received accuracy.&lt;p>Calibration methods:&lt;br>&lt;strong>2 points: &lt;/strong>Will be available in the future. This method only works under some very special circumstances.&lt;br>&lt;strong>3 points: &lt;/strong>The normal method.&lt;br>&lt;strong>4 points: &lt;/strong>Suggested method if you are using camera pictures of maps. Takes the skew of the image into account.&lt;p>Please direct questions and comments to MapCalibrator@gmail.com.</string>
    <string name="str_menu_information_3_points">New in this version:&lt;p>*A lot of changes has been made under the hood to be able to use Fragments. This will make it a lot easier to add good looking stuff in the future, so stay tuned.&lt;p>NOTE: Take care what is in the "Accuracy" and "Age" fields when you save a reference point. A bad accuracy or an old measurement (if you have changed your position since) will ruin the calibration of the map.&lt;p>MapCalibrator now contains experimental support for using very large images with full resolution (no down sampling). This support must be enabled in the preferences before loading a map.&lt;p>MapCalibrator takes an image of a custom map and calibrates it to the real world using 3 reference points.&lt;p>Use the built in camera to take a picture of a map at the site, or store a high resolution map on the sd-card before going out.&lt;p>Use the &lt;strong>menu&lt;/strong> button to see all available options.&lt;p>The intended workflow is:&lt;br>1. Import a map from a file (or the camera).&lt;br>2. Create a reference point.&lt;br>3. Position the reference poin at your current position on the map.&lt;br>4.
